### Salaam 👋🏼 

I'm Qasira, a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer from Seattle.
<br><br>
Right now, I am enjoying taking on freelance web development projects.
<br> I love building websites for small businesses and community organizations in my free time.
<br>I am seeking Technical Recruiter roles at this time, as I am best suited for a full-time non-technical role within the tech industry.
<br>I am interested primarily in teams and organizations focused on social impact.
<br><br>
I am proud to be a Muslim woman in tech, and I look forward to the day when I can use
<br> my skills as a developer to benefit my community and, more broadly, the world we live in.
<br><br>
