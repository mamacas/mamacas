### Salaam 👋🏼 

I'm Qasira, a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer from Seattle.
<br><br>
Right now, I am enjoying taking on freelance web development projects. I love building websites for small businesses and community organizations in my free time.
<br>I am also seeking Technical Recruiter roles at this time, as I am best suited for a full-time non-technical role within the tech industry.
