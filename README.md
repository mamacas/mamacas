### Salaam 👋🏼 

I'm Cas, a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer from Seattle.
<br><br>
I am a front-end dev at heart, but I also enjoy the challenge of a data-driven back-end project. 
<br>As such, I love building full-stack applications with front-end Frameworks, including React;
<br>it is the perfect intersection of logic and creativity.
<br><br>
Right now, I am building my portfolio with freelance projects, diving deeper into data structures & algorithms,
<br>and seeking Technical Program Manager or Entry-level Developer roles.
<br>I am interested primarily in teams and organizations focused on social impact.
<br><br>
I am proud to be a Muslim woman in tech, and I look forward to the day when I can use
<br> my skills as a developer to benefit my community and, more broadly, the world we live in.
<br><br>
